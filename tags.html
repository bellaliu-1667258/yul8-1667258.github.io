        <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.billboard.com/photos/6605775/edc-las-vegas-2015-festival-raised-the-bar">
        At the preceding week's EDMbiz Conference and Expo, Insomniac founder Pasquale Rotella 
        declared that this year's EDC Las Vegas would be "bigger and better" than anything 
        he'd done before. He wasn't lying. With jaw-dropping new stages, revamped production and a dazzling array of art cars, fireworks, and guest performers, EDC Las Vegas, which took place from June 19-21, pulled out all the stops this year to deliver an unprecedented rave experience to its more than 135,000 nightly attendees. 
        Billboard takes a look back at some of the stages that helped set a new standard in festival production.
